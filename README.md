- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amm414. I graduated from Pitt in the winter of 2019. I have a double major in Computer Science and Economics-Statistics. 


- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many different areas. 
 
  + In programming, I find my interests lie in developing the backend of applications and algorithms that oganize and gain insights from data. 
  
  + As a CS and Stat major, I find data science and machine learning to be very interesting. I am trying to learn new techniques
  and methods to analyze big data and high dimensional data. With these techniques, I am trying to analyze US Census data with regards to education and income.

  + As an economist with a programming and statistical background, I am interested in utility theory and behaviorial economics. These directly connect with my 
  underlying interest in Artificial Intelligence as these areas of economics can help improve AI models and agents. A current project I am working on is agent-based 
  models, where agents defined by their utility functions and preferences put into a psecific situation. 
  
  + As an economist macroeconomic trends and events. Some macroeconomic trends and events that interest me are the 2008 recession and financial collaspe, 
  income and wealth trends, and the effects and evolution of education on the GDP and global markets. 



- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  
  + Technically Full Stack web programming with Python and Flask. The frontend utilizes basic JavaScript and Bootstrap to create a 
  simple and responsive website which holds my projects I have finished, new projects I am working on to become more knowledgeable 
  of the domains I am interested in, and present and market myself as a good hire for any firm. 
  
  + Agent-Based Modeling and AI agent decision making. Utilizing probabilistic decision making and stochastic events to analyze situations like the 
  Schelling segregation model that shows that even without racist agents, neighborhoods naturally trend towards homogeneity rather than heterogeneity. 
  
  + Data Science techniques utilizing Python. Primarily to analyze education and income/wealth data from the Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
  I have worked previous projects that utilized R, but I am trying to familiarize myself with Python's many libraries for data science.
