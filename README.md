# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amm414.

## A little about myself ...

I am motivated to solve complex business problems with software and data. While I am interested in software development, I graduated with a double major from the University of Pittsburgh in Economics-Statistics and Computer Science. My philosophy follows the life-long learner mentality. I desire to continue growing, learning, and improving both professionally and personally. I hope to deliver results for businesses that improve efficiency, productivity, and improving the world one commit at a time!

### Now A little about my interests:

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many different areas. 
 
  + In developing software that improves productivity and efficiency. I believe software is critical in all industries and is key for the future as population stagnates and declines. 
  + In manipulating, organizing, aggregating, and understanding large amounts of data. 
  + In backend development where I am "closer" to the data and have more responsibility for organizing it in a proper way that is scalable and maintainable. 
  + In machine learning and AI; though more from a data analysis perspective, rather than self-driving car perspective. I believe AI and machine learning will deliver huge benefits over the coming decade allowing people to become more productive than before.
  + In utility theory and behavior economics. These directly connect with my underlying interest in Artificial Intelligence as these areas of economics can help improve AI models and agents.
  + In macroeconomic trends and events. Some macroeconomic trends and events that interest me are the 2008 recession and financial collaspe, 
  income and wealth trends, and the effects and evolution of education on the GDP and global markets. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and improving:
  
  + Angular and its many components. I have only about 1 year of work experience, and I realize I have soo much more to learn!
  + Dynamic and reactive website design. It is critical for my current role as a Frontend Developer for Artech at Google.
  + About various economic theories and following economic events. Though unrelated to software, I believe being more holistic will benefit myself and my work.
  
## Future Plans

- Rewrite my website. I wish to follow better practices and have unit testing from the beginning / launch. Additionally, I would like to use Angular on the frontend and either Python (Fast API or Django), C#, or Rust on the backend. The database would be some flavor of SQL. 

- Improve my Website Tracker Application for managing the content updates, content metadata (like descriptions), bug reports, feature requests, and development log (new component). This will be done as I transition over to the new tech stack TBD. I will probably remove users being required and limit number of bugs / FRs made. The key is a new focus on what has happened dev-wise recently on the website.

- Personal projects to improve and learn new skills. I would like to brush up on Java and my data science skills. I would like to learn C++ and Rust.

## Other Repositories:

#### [CraigVersity](https://github.com/amm414/CS1530-Software-Engineering-Project): the repository holding the source code, documentation, testing, and other miscellaneous content surrounding the Fall 2019 software engineering project done as a group of 5 at Pitt. 

#### [My Project Repository](https://github.com/amm414/Projects): a repository that collects many different types of content largely found on my [personal website](https://andrew-morgan-website.herokuapp.com). 

#### [Agent-Based Modeling](https://github.com/amm414/Agent-Based-Modeling): a repository on simulating worlds of autonomous agents that make decisions. Typically used to analyze the resulting system-level patterns that emerge and are present.
